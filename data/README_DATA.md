# Synthetic Data Folder

This folder contains **only synthetic data**.

- No real insurance company information  
- No client data  
- No confidential sources  

The file `synthetic_va_block.csv` is generated using  
`synthetic_data/generate_synthetic_block.py`.

It simulates features commonly seen in market-linked insurance products (e.g., account values, guarantee bases, product types).
