# Market-Linked Products Analytics Lab (Synthetic)

A Python + Streamlit project demonstrating analytics used for **market-sensitive insurance products** such as variable annuities (VA) and fixed indexed annuities (FIA).  

This lab includes synthetic scenario generation, derivatives valuation, hedging simulation, and stress testing — all using **fully synthetic data**.

## Key Capabilities

- Equity scenario generation (GBM)
- Black–Scholes & Monte Carlo valuation
- Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta)
- Delta-hedging backtests & P&L distributions
- Hedge effectiveness metrics (VaR, ES)
- Equity/vol/rate shock scenarios
- Interactive Streamlit dashboard
- Synthetic policy block (optional)

Everything in this repository uses **synthetic, safe, non-proprietary data**.

No real insurer, reinsurer, employer, or client data is used.
